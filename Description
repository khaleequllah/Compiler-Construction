C++ is extensively used programming language. You are required to develop a lexical analyzer of C++. 
This program will input a source code from file input.txt , and will find potential tokens and display their typealong their values. 
Following pattern will be used.
TOKEN_TYPE TOKEN_VALUE
You are required to find following potential tokens.

1.Strings
2.Single Line and multiline comments
3.Keywords (You can find list of keywords on web)
4.Arithmatic Operators (List can be found on web)
5.Logical Operators (List can be found on web)
6.Library name (pattern will be like <stdio.h>)
7.Digits
8.Floating point numbers

There will be many lexeme separator, like space, arithmetic operators, logical operators etc etc. 
You have used C++, you MUST identify potential lexeme separators and implement lexical analyzer by yourself.

This file will have all NFAâ€™s (which you think are required for this task),
and python source code.
